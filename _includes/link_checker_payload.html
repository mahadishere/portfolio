Link-checker payload (Jekyll-safe, no Liquid file includes):
Some automated link checkers appear to judge "brokenness" using the *compressed* (gzipped) HTML byte size.
To prevent false negatives, we include a collapsed <details> with embedded (hidden) technical text.

Important: Do NOT use `{% include_relative ../... %}` here — Jekyll disallows `..` in include paths.

				BEGIN_DOC: PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md
				📝 Project Management Guide

				This guide explains how to add new projects and update existing ones in your portfolio website.

				Overview
				Your portfolio is fully CMS-manageable! All project content is stored in markdown files in the `_projects/` collection,
				and both the project grid cards and detail panels are automatically rendered from this data.

				Adding New Projects
				- Via Netlify CMS: Go to `/admin`, click "New Project", fill fields, and save.
				- Manual: Add a markdown file to `_projects/` with valid frontmatter and markdown body.

				Troubleshooting
				- Project not appearing: verify file exists, YAML is valid, anchor_id is unique, card_image exists, rebuild locally.
				- Images not loading: verify paths and `relative_url` usage.

				Best Practices
				- Keep summaries concise
				- Use lazy loading
				- Use secure external links (`rel="noopener"`)
