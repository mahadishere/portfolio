It is designed to detect anomalies in medical imaging with high precision.

Using a powerful ensemble of state-of-the-art segmentation and classification deep-learning models, the system analyzes MRI scans to identify structural abnormalities across various organs.

The solution produces pixel-level segmentation masks, highlights regions of concern, and classifies detected anomalies—helping radiologists accelerate diagnosis, reduce oversight errors, and improve clinical decision-making.
