It is designed to extract, interpret, and summarize complex technical information from PDF documents—particularly those related to mechanical instruments and engineering specifications.

The system processes unstructured text, diagrams, and tabular data, transforming them into clear, concise summaries that are easier to read and understand. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and information-extraction algorithms, It identifies key parameters, functional descriptions, safety notes, and technical insights, enabling engineers and technicians to quickly comprehend detailed specification documents.
