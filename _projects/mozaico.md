Mozaico AR lets you visualize stunning mosaic designs on your walls and floors before making a purchase. Using your phone, you can preview how different mosaics will look in your space with ease.

What is Augmented Reality (AR)?

Augmented Reality (AR) enables you to place digital images in your real-world environment through your device’s camera. Simply select a mosaic design, point your camera at your wall or floor, and instantly see how it fits in your space—no guesswork needed!
