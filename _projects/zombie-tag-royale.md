header_note: You've been captured by the Dark Wizard "Red Beard" who has taken
  you to become part of his Zombie Army. "Red Beard" is a huge fan of Tag, it's
  his favorite sport, so "Red Beard" has created a high stakes game of tag where
  the last survivor will win their freedom, keep their humanity, and win a Pizza
  Party in their honor. "Red Beards" favorite food is Pizza and his Zombie chefs
  were trained in Italy to make the best Pizza for the winner of the Tag
  Tournament. Do you have what it takes to keep your Humanity and win that Pizza
  Party!?!
