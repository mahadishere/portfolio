# Background Music

Place your background music file(s) in this directory.

## Supported Formats

- **MP3** (recommended): `background-music.mp3`
- **OGG** (fallback): `background-music.ogg`

## File Naming

The music player expects files named:
- `background-music.mp3` (primary)
- `background-music.ogg` (fallback for better browser compatibility)

## Adding Music via CMS

You can also add music files through Netlify CMS. The files will be stored in this directory.

## Notes

- Music loops automatically when playing
- User preference (play/pause state) is saved in localStorage
- Autoplay may be blocked by browsers - users must click the music button to start playback
