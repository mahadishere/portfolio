/*
	DEPRECATED: This file has been refactored into modular CSS files.
	
	The site now uses modular CSS files loaded directly in _includes/head.html.
	See assets/css/modules/ for the new structure:
	
	- variables.css: CSS custom properties (replaces this file's variables)
	- theme.css: Theme toggle, music toggle, theme application (replaces this file's theme styles)
	- mega-menu.css: Mega menu styles (replaces this file's navigation styles)
	- project-cards.css, project-filters.css, project-badges.css: Project-related styles
	
	This file is kept for reference only. All styles have been moved to modular files.
